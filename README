General description:
	Here my results of experiments with dsPIC33 controllers 
	directed to audio effects implementation.
	Described how to build own guitar pedal based dsPIC33FJ128GP802 IC.
	Also, part of effects was ported and run using 
	MPLAB dsPIC Starter Kit 1:

Device specification:
	Effect types : 12
	Effects applying max : 4 simultaneous effects
	Sampling frequency : ~20 kHz
	A/D converter : 12 bit
	D/A converter : 16 bit
	Signal processing : 32-16 bit
	Frequency response : 20 Hz – 10 kHz 
	Display : 1-digit 7-segment LED indicator
	Input : Standard mono phone jack
	Input impedance : 1 megaohm
	Output : Standard stereo phone jack
	
	Power requirements:
	AC adapter 9 V DC, 300 mA (center minus plug)  

Building configuration:
	Win XP, MPLAB X 2.10, MPLAB C30 v3.31.

Building dependencies:
	The libq-coff.a library from C30 compiller needed.

Projects description:
	foundation_test.X - foundation library testing project. 
	Compile and run simulator. 
	See UART1 output or set breakpoints in appropriate places.
	pedal_selftest.X - hardware testing project. 
	Tests indicator, buttons, ADC - DAC loop.
	pedal.X - main DSPIC Guitar Pedal project.
	dspic33_dsc_sk1.X - effects library porting to 
	dsPIC MPLAB Starter Kit 1.
	dspic33_dsc_sk1_selftest.X - hardware test, same as for pedal project.

Programming without building:
	See hex folder.

Notes:
	When I investigated ADC -> DAC loop I met a problem, 
	that right channel of audio DAC worked better then left. 
	The hissing noise had appeared in it in some cases. Seems like, 
	it my IC's specific.
